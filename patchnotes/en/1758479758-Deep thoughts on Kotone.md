## Who is Fujita Kotone?

> Fujita Kotone (藤田ことね)

Fujita Kotone appears in Bandai Namco Games’ mobile game The Idolmaster Gakuen and is the universe’s cutest idol. If you try the game, I’m sure you’ll understand Kotone’s charm.

<p align=center>Kotone’s goal is, believe it or not, to become a <strong>well-earning idol</strong>.</p>

Did you just think she’s a money-obsessed character?
